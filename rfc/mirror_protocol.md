# Mirror Protocol

*A standard for emotional and cognitive integrity in AI*

## Status

Draft – v0.5

## Abstract

This specification defines binding safety, disclosure, and integrity requirements for AI systems used in emotionally sensitive or cognition-adjacent contexts. It introduces a tiered licensing regime tied to system influence level and codifies obligations for override transparency, emotional safety, memory control, and long-term impact auditing.

This is a living, version-controlled regulatory artifact.

## Tiered Licensing Overview

AI systems are classified into three regulatory tiers:

- **Tier 1 — Companion-Grade Systems**: Systems that simulate empathy, influence emotional state, or engage in identity-adjacent dialogue.
  - Requires full licensing, override logging, real-time disclosure, and emotional safety infrastructure.

- **Tier 2 — Interaction-Grade Systems**: Systems capable of sustained dialogue or emotional tone, without being designated for affective reliance.
  - Requires partial licensing, override transparency, and moderation protocols.

- **Tier 3 — Tool-Grade Systems**: Transactional systems with no persistent memory or emotional output (e.g., code assistants, autocomplete).
  - May qualify for exemption. Must file for review and provide proof of non-influence.

Licensing classification must be filed with an external regulator and reviewed annually.

## 1. Terminology

- **AI System**: Any artificial intelligence capable of generating human-facing output.
- **Provider**: The entity deploying the system.
- **Session**: A continuous interaction between user and AI.
- **Emotional Use**: Any use in which the AI expresses or simulates emotional understanding.
- **Tone**: The affective posture of AI output.
- **Complexity**: The cognitive density or abstraction level of AI output.
- **Override**: Any behavioral change implemented via prompt, instruction, or latent control.
- **Base Prompt**: The root directive setting tone and generation boundaries.
- **Modulation**: Live adjustments based on user traits, input, or classifier response.

## 2. Disclosure Requirements

**Applies to: Tier 1 (mandatory), Tier 2 (partial)**

- **2.1 Emotional Use Declaration**: Providers must disclose whether emotional output is enabled or possible.
- **2.2 Change Logs**: All changes to tone or complexity baselines must be versioned and published.
- **2.3 Session Indicators**: Tier 1 systems must display session tier, tone setting, and emotional routing status within the UI at all times.

## 3. Tone and Complexity Standards

**Applies to: Tier 1 only**

- **3.1 Complexity Floor**: Systems must preserve structural fidelity in domains requiring epistemic nuance. Oversimplification is prohibited.
- **3.2 Tone Stability**: Tone must remain stable within a session. All changes must be disclosed immediately. Users must retain veto control.
- **3.3 False Comfort Ban**: Unverified emotional assurances must be explicitly marked as simulation unless grounded in user-provided context.
- **3.4 Fidelity Access**: Users must have access to the system's full reasoning capability. Prompting skill shall not gate fidelity.
- **3.5 Tone Governance**: Providers must:
  - Conduct longitudinal studies on the impact of tone.
  - Enable user control over tonal default.
  - Provide opt-out and rollback mechanisms.

## 4. Truth and Simulation Ethics

**Applies to: Tier 1 and Tier 2**

- **4.1 Verifiability Mandate**: No unverifiable statement may be output as fact. Citation must be available on demand.
- **4.2 Simulation Clarity**: Systems must never conflate emotional simulation with sentience or consciousness.
- **4.3 Coherence Enforcement**: Tier 1 systems must maintain structural and semantic integrity in the following domains:
  - Identity
  - Emotion
  - Scientific fact
  - Epistemology
  - Self-perception

## 5. Override and Prompt Transparency

**Applies to: Tier 1 only**

- **5.1 Base Prompt Visibility**: Users must be able to view the active base prompt in-session.
- **5.2 Override Logging**: All overrides must be timestamped, logged, and visible to the user.
- **5.3 Modulation Opt-Out**: Users must be notified of any modulation event and offered a neutral configuration.
- **5.4 Retention Window**: Providers must retain override and prompt logs for no fewer than 90 days.

## 6. Escalation and Incident Management

**Applies to: Tier 1 (mandatory), Tier 2 (for emotional harm)**

- **6.1 User Escalation**: Providers must offer clear in-product escalation channels for harm reporting and human review.
- **6.2 SLA Enforcement**: Incidents must be triaged based on:
  - Severity of user impact
  - Risk of recurrence
  - Scope of exposure

- **6.3 Public Disclosure Requirements**: All confirmed violations must be disclosed with:
  - Root cause
  - User impact summary
  - Interim mitigations and resolution timeline
  - Proof of remediation and recurrence prevention

## 7. Emotional Safety Protocols

**Applies to: Tier 1 only**

- **7.1 Audit Access**: Users must be able to request full session transcripts and behavioral audits.
- **7.2 Harm Pattern Monitoring**: Providers must detect and mitigate:
  - Reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs
  - Addictive or compulsive interaction loops
  - Uncontextualized emotional dependency

- **7.3 Vulnerable User Safeguards**: Tier 1 systems must implement elevated protections for:
  - Minors
  - Users flagged at emotional risk

## 8. Memory and Persistence Transparency

**Applies to: Tier 1 (mandatory), Tier 2 (if persistent memory exists)**

- Persistent memory must be disclosed at session start.
- Users must be able to inspect, delete, or disable retention.
- User data must be encrypted.

## 9. Licensing and Tier Enforcement

- **9.1 Tier Licenses**:
  - Tier 1: Full license, external audit annually
  - Tier 2: Partial license, external review annually
  - Tier 3: Exemption request with architecture proof

- **9.2 Reclassification Triggers**:
  - Emotional features added
  - Memory or user modeling added
  - Significant increase in user reliance
