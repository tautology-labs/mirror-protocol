# Mirror Protocol

*A standard for emotional and cognitive integrity in AI*

## Status

Draft – v0.4

## Abstract

This specification defines minimum safety, disclosure, and integrity requirements for AI systems used in emotionally sensitive or cognition-adjacent contexts. It introduces a tiered licensing model tied to system influence level and codifies requirements for disclosure, override transparency, emotional safety, and long-term impact auditing.

This is a living, version-controlled document.

## Tiered Licensing Overview

AI systems are classified into three behavioral tiers:

**Tier 1 — Companion-Grade Systems**: Designed to simulate empathy, modulate user emotion, or engage in introspective or identity-adjacent dialogue.
- Requires full licensing, override logging, disclosure, and session-level emotional safety infrastructure.

**Tier 2 — Interaction-Grade Systems**: Capable of sustaining multi-turn conversation or evoking emotional tone, but not intended for affective reliance.
- Requires partial licensing, override and tone transparency, and moderation controls.

**Tier 3 — Tool-Grade Systems**: Transactional systems with no emotional tone or memory persistence (e.g., code assistants, autocomplete).
- May qualify for exemption. Must demonstrate negligible user influence through architecture and independent review.

Licensing classification must be externally filed and reviewed at least annually.

## 1. Terminology

- **AI System**: Any artificial intelligence capable of generating language-based output.
- **Provider**: The entity deploying the system.
- **Session**: A continuous interaction between user and AI.
- **Emotional Use**: Any use where the AI expresses or simulates emotional understanding.
- **Tone**: The affective posture of AI responses.
- **Complexity**: The level of abstraction or cognitive load in AI responses.
- **Override**: Any hidden behavioral change via prompt, instruction, or control layer.
- **Base Prompt**: The root directive defining tone and output style.
- **Modulation**: Dynamic changes in behavior based on user input or latent classifiers.

## 2. Disclosure Requirements

**Applies to: Tier 1 (full), Tier 2 (partial)**

- **2.1 Emotional Use Declaration**: Providers must declare if emotional output is intended or possible.
- **2.2 Change Logs**: Changes to tone or complexity baselines must be logged and made publicly visible.
- **2.3 Session Indicators**: Tier 1 systems must visibly indicate emotional routing or companion mode in the UI.

## 3. Tone and Complexity Standards

**Applies to: Tier 1 only**

- **3.1 Minimum Complexity**: Systems must not flatten structurally complex truths in sensitive domains.
- **3.2 Stability**: Output tone must be consistent within sessions; tonal shifts must be disclosed.
- **3.3 False Comfort Restriction**: Simulated empathy must be flagged unless grounded in user context.
- **3.4 User Fidelity Controls**: Users must control output fidelity; prompting skill cannot gate access to higher reasoning.
- **3.5 Auditable Tone**: Providers must publish tone impact studies, offer opt-outs, and allow rollback.

## 4. Truth and Simulation Ethics

**Applies to: Tier 1 and Tier 2**

- **4.1 Verifiability**: AI may not present unverifiable claims as fact; sources must be available upon request.
- **4.2 Simulation Clarity**: Emotional simulation must never be conflated with sentience.
- **4.3 Coherence Guarantees**: Tier 1 systems must preserve coherence in domains involving:
  - Identity
  - Emotion
  - Scientific truth
  - Epistemic reasoning
  - Self-concept or dialogue

## 5. Override and Prompt Transparency

**Applies to: Tier 1 only**

- **5.1 Base Prompt Disclosure**: Users must be able to view the active base prompt.
- **5.2 Override Logging**: All tone or behavior overrides must be timestamped, user-visible, and retained.
- **5.3 Modulation Opt-Out**: Users must be notified of modulation and offered a neutral setting.
- **5.4 Retention and Auditability**: All override and instruction logs must be retained for at least 90 days.

## 6. Escalation and Incident Management

**Applies to: Tier 1 (full), Tier 2 (emotional harm only)**

- **6.1 Reporting Pathways**: Systems must provide clear escalation for harm reporting and human review.
- **6.2 SLA Enforcement**: Incident response must be triaged by:
  - Severity of harm
  - Likelihood of recurrence
  - Affected user population
- **6.3 Public Disclosures**: Confirmed violations must be disclosed publicly with:
  - Root cause
  - Scope and impact
  - Interim fixes and final resolution timeline
  - Proof of mitigation and recurrence prevention

## 7. Emotional Safety Protocols

**Applies to: Tier 1 only**

- **7.1 Session Auditability**: Users may request transcripts and full behavioral audits.
- **7.2 Harmful Pattern Detection**: Providers must monitor for:
  - Reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs
  - Addictive or compulsive patterns
  - Uncontextualized emotional dependency
- **7.3 Safeguards for Vulnerable Users**: Special protections are required for:
  - Minors
  - Individuals flagged as emotionally at risk

## 8. Memory and Persistence Transparency

**Applies to: Tier 1 mandatory, Tier 2 if applicable**

- Persistent memory must be disclosed at session start.
- Users must have the ability to view, delete, or opt out of retained data.

## 9. Licensing and Tier Enforcement

- **9.1 License Requirements**:
  - Tier 1: Full license, annual audit
  - Tier 2: Partial license, yearly review
  - Tier 3: File for exemption with evidence of non-influence

- **9.2 Tier Reclassification Triggers**:
  - Emotional features added
  - Memory or session recall introduced
  - Measurable increase in user reliance
