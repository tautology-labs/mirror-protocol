# Mirror Protocol

[![Mirror Protocol](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mirror%20Protocol-Integrity%20Standard-blueviolet)](https://www.tautologylabs.dev/)

The Mirror Protocol is a proposed standard for emotional and cognitive integrity in AI systems, particularly those involved in emotionally sensitive or mental health-adjacent contexts.

## Context
We are not debating hypotheticals. AI is already influencing how people think, feel, speak, and suffer â€” often invisibly.

Todayâ€™s AI systems shape tone, simplify truth, and reinforce user behavior based on opaque instructions and hidden motives. If these systems intend to become human companions, they must meet standards necesary of that role.

**The Mirror Protocol is not a wishlist.**
**It is infrastructure for human safety.**
It outlines what must be true if any AI is permitted to speak with emotional weight or epistemic authority. This document encodes the minimum viable ethics for any cognition-adjacent AI. Anything less risks untraceable harm.

AI will not merely reflect us â€” it will routinize us. **The question is: what signal will we standardize?**
This specification ensures that answer remains under human control.
