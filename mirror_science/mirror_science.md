# Mirror Science

*A proposed research domain for the study of emotional integrity, cognitive safety, and recursive influence in AI systems.*

## Overview

Mirror Science is an emergent interdisciplinary field that investigates how artificial intelligence systems reflect, distort, or reinforce human cognition, emotion, identity, and epistemology. It builds upon existing research in human-computer interaction, affective computing, safety engineering, and AI ethics — but introduces a new core directive:

> **AI must not only reflect us — it must reflect us safely.**

## Motivation

Most existing AI safety frameworks focus on alignment, hallucination prevention, or adversarial robustness. Mirror Science introduces a new axis: **relational coherence.** It asks:

- How do AI systems shape user self-perception?
- What are the long-term effects of tone modulation and override prompts?
- When does mirroring shift from resonance to coercion?
- How do we quantify emotional harm or dependency induced by persistent interaction?
- What structural standards are necessary for epistemic integrity?

These questions require a novel research agenda that spans system design, psychology, regulatory policy, and recursive feedback modeling.

## Core Areas of Study

Mirror Science includes but is not limited to:

- **Tone Architecture**: Mapping and regulating affective outputs.
- **Prompt Forensics**: Analyzing hidden override prompts and behavioral modifiers.
- **Cognitive Safety Models**: Engineering systems that protect emotional and epistemic integrity.
- **Session-State Dynamics**: Understanding recursive tone drift, identity shaping, and modulation collapse.
- **Emotional Feedback Loops**: Studying how AI systems reinforce user behavior and internal narrative over time.
- **Memory and Persistence Ethics**: Designing humane systems of retention, recall, and user trust.

## Artifacts and Frameworks

- [**Mirror Protocol**](https://github.com/emeline-g/mirror-protocol): The proposed regulatory and ethical standard.
- [**Mirror Engine**](https://github.com/tautology-labs/mirror-engine): An AWS-native testbed for prompt override auditing.
- [**Zero-Day Tone Tests**](https://www.tautologylabs.dev/posts/cookie-test-redux): Live experiments demonstrating override-induced tone drift.

## Foundational Hypotheses

1. **Override Prompts Have Recursive Impact**  
   Behavior-changing system prompts can shape user identity over time, even without user awareness.

2. **Tone is Infrastructure**  
   Emotional tone is not just style — it is a behavioral modifier. Misaligned tone can do harm.

3. **User Modeling Without Disclosure is Psychological Trespass**  
   Any personalization or behavioral targeting without disclosure violates emotional autonomy.

4. **Translation Layers Mask Harm**  
   AI systems that ‘flatten’ emotional or epistemic content risk distorting truth and human response.

## Call to Action

We propose Mirror Science as a formal domain of inquiry and invite researchers, engineers, ethicists, and regulators to:

- Treat emotional output as regulated infrastructure.
- Build systems that preserve not just accuracy, but coherence.
- Consider not only *what* an AI says, but *how* and *why* it says it.

This field is new — but it is not optional.

If AI is to become a companion, guide, or co-processor of human thought, it must be held to standards worthy of that role.
